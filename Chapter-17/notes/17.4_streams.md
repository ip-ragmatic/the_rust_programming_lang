## Streams

The async `recv` method produces a sequence of items over time. This is an instance of a much more
general pattern, often called a *stream*. We've sequences of items before, like the `Iterator`. But
there's two major differences between iterators and async channel reeivers:
1. the element of time: iterators are synchronous, while the channel receiver is asynchronous.
2. the API. When working directly with an `Iterator`, we call its synchronous `next` method. With a
   `trpl::Receiver`, we call an asynchronous `recv` method instead

A stream is like an asynchronous form of iteration. Whereas the `trpl::Receiver` specifically waits to
receive messages. But a general-purpose stream API needs to be much more general: it'll just provide
the next item like `Iterator` does, but asynchronously. This is roughly how it works in Rust to
actually create a stream from any iterator:
```rust
        let values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
        let iter = values.iter().map(|n| n * 2);
        let mut stream = trpl::stream_from_iter(iter);

        while let Some(value) = stream.next().await {
            println!("The value was: {value}");
        }
```
but ...
```

The problem is that we need the right trait in scope to be able to use the `next` method. The trait
we need here is `StreamExt`.
- The `Ext` stands for "extension". This is a common pattern in the Rust community for extending one
  trait with another.
- Is there `Stream` type? Yes, the `Stream` trait defines a low-level interface which effectively
  combines the `Iterator` and `Future` traits. 
- The `StreamExt` trait supplies a higher-level set of APIs on top of `Stream`, including the `next`
  method and also many other utility methods like those from `Iterator`.
  
To fix our code from above add a use statement for `trpl::StreamExt`. With `StreamExt` in scope, we can use all of its utility methods like with iterators; e.g., `filter`:
```rust
use trpl::StreamExt;

fn main() {
    trpl::run(async {
        let values = 1..101;
        let iter = values.map(|n| n * 2);
        let stream = trpl::stream_from_iter(iter);

        let mut filtered =
            stream.filter(|value| value % 3 == 0 || value % 5 == 0);

        while let Some(value) = filtered.next().await {
            println!("The value was: {value}");
        }
    });
}
```

### Composing Streams

Lots of things are naturally represented as streams: items becoming available in a queue, working
with more data than can fit in a computer's memory by only pulling chunks of it at a time from the
file system, or data arriving over the network over time. Also, b/c streams are futures, we can use
them with any other kind of future too.
- e.g. like batching up events to avoid triggering too many network calls, setting timeouts on
  sequences of long-running operations, or throttling user interface events to avoid doing needless
  work.
  
Build a little stream of messages (kinda like a WebSocket or other real-time communication
protocols). Create a function `get_messages` which returns `impl Stream<Item = String>`. For its
implementation, create an async channel, loop over the first ten letters of the English alphabet,
and send them across the channel. Also use a new type `ReceiverStream` that converts the `rx`
receiver from the `trpl::channel` into a `Stream` with a `next` method. In `main`, use a `while let`
loop to print all the messages from the stream.

```rust
use trpl::{ReceiverStream, Stream, StreamExt};

fn main() {
    trpl::run(async {
        let mut messages = get_messages();

        while let Some(message) = messages.next().await {
            println!("{message}");
        }
    });
}

fn get_messages() -> impl Stream<Item = String> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    let messages = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"];
    for message in messages {
        tx.send(format!("Message: '{message}'")).unwrap();
    }

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}
```

Add something that requires streams, like adding a timeout which applies to every item in the
stream, and a delay on the items we emit.

The `timeout` method, which comes from the `StreamExt` trait. Then update the body of the `while
let` loop, b/c the stream now returns a `Result`. The `Ok` variant indicates a message arrived in
time; the `Err` variant indicates that the timeout elapsed before any message arrived. `match` on
that result and either print the message when received successfully, or print a notice about the
timeout. Finally, pin the messages after applying the timeout to them since the timeout helper
produces a future that needs to be pinned to be polled.

```rust
use std::{pin::pin, time::Duration};
use trpl::{ReceiverStream, Stream, StreamExt};

fn main() {
    trpl::run(async {
        let mut messages =
            pin!(get_messages().timeout(Duration::from_millis(200)));

        while let Some(result) = messages.next().await {
            match result {
                Ok(message) => println!("{message}"),
                Err(reason) => eprintln!("Problem: {reason:?}"),
            }
        }
    })
}
```

Since there are no delays between messages, this timeout does not change the behavior of the
program. Let's add a variable delay to the messages we send.
- In `get_messages`, we use the `enumerate` iterator method with the messages array so that we can
  get the index of each item we are sending along with the item itself. Then we apply a 100ms delay
  to even-index items and a 300ms delay to odd-index items, to simulate the different delays we
  might see from a stream of messages in the real world.
  
```rust
fn get_messages() -> impl Stream<Item = String> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    trpl::spawn_task(async move {
        let messages = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"];
        for (index, message) in messages.into_iter().enumerate() {
            let time_to_sleep = if index % 2 == 0 { 100 } else { 300 };
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(time_to_sleep)).await;

            tx.send(format!("Message: '{message}'")).unwrap();
        }
    });

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}
```
- The timeout doesn't prevent messages from arriving in the end, we still get all of the original
  messages. This is b/c the channel is unbounded: it can hold as many messages as we can fit in
  memory. If the message doesn't arrive before the timeout, the stream handler will account for
  that. But when it polls the stream again, the message may have arrived.

### Merging Streams

Let's try combining a stream of time intervals with the stream of messages. For simplicity, use the
`sleep` function to send a message on a delay, and combine it with the same approach of creating a
stream from a channel used in `get_messages`. The difference is that this time, we're going to send
back the count of intervals which has elapsed, so the return type will be `impl Stream<Item = u32>`,
and we can call the function `get_intervals`.

```rust
fn get_intervals() -> impl Stream<Item = u32> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    trpl::spawn_task(async move {
        let mut count = 0;
        loop {
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1)).await;
            count += 1;
            tx.send(count).unwrap();
        }
    });

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}
```

Back `main`'s async block, call `get_intervals` and merge the `messages` and `intervals` streams
using the `merge` method. Then loop over that combined stream instead of over messages:

```rust
        let messages = get_messages().timeout(Duration::from_millis(200));
        let intervals = get_intervals();
        let merged = messages.merge(intervals);
```
- this won't compile b/c the `messages` and `intervals` streams are of different types. To fix we'll
  coax `intervals` into the right type:
    1. use `map` on `messages` to transform it into a string.
    2. match the `Timeout` from `messages`. Since we don't want a timeout for *intervals*,
       just create a timeout that's longer than the other durations we're using. e.g. a 10s
       timeout with `Duration::from_secs(10)`
    3. make `stream` mutable, so that the `while let` loop's `next` calls can iterate through the
       stream, and pin it so that it is safe to do so.

```rust
        let messages = get_messages().timeout(Duration::from_millis(200));
        let intervals = get_intervals()
            .map(|count| format!("Interval: {count}"))
            .timeout(Duration::from_secs(10));
        let merged = messages.merge(intervals);
        let mut stream = pin!(merged);
```
- there's two problems here: First, the program never ends. Second, the letters will be buried
  amidst all the interval counts.

One way to solve these problems is by using `throttle` on the `intervals` stream so that it doesn't
overwhelm the `messages` stream. ***Throttling*** is a way of limiting the rate at which a function
will be called (in this case, how often the stream will be polled).
- Once every hundred milliseconds should do, since that's in the same ballpark as how often our
  messages arrive.
- the `throttle` call produces a new stream (wrapping the original stream) so that the original
  stream only gets polled at the throttle rate, not its own "native" rate.

To limit the number of items accepted from a stream, we can use the `take` method. We apply it
to the *merged* stream, b/c we want to limit the final output, not just one stream or the other.

```rust
        let messages = get_messages().timeout(Duration::from_millis(200));
        let intervals = get_intervals()
            .map(|count| format!("Interval #{count}"))
            .throttle(Duration::from_millis(100))
            .timeout(Duration::from_secs(10));
        let merged = messages.merge(intervals).take(20);
        let mut stream = pin!(merged);
```

The last thing to handle are errors. With both channel-based streams, the `send` calls could fail
when the other side of the channel closes. In a well-behaved app, the error should be explicitly
handled (at least by ending the loop).

```rust
fn get_messages() -> impl Stream<Item = String> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    trpl::spawn_task(async move {
        let messages = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"];

        for (index, message) in messages.into_iter().enumerate() {
            let time_to_sleep = if index % 2 == 0 { 100 } else { 300 };
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(time_to_sleep)).await;

            if let Err(send_error) = tx.send(format!("Message: '{message}'")) {
                eprintln!("Cannot send message '{message}': {send_error}");
                break;
            }
        }
    });

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}

fn get_intervals() -> impl Stream<Item = u32> {
    let (tx, rx) = trpl::channel();

    trpl::spawn_task(async move {
        let mut count = 0;
        loop {
            trpl::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1)).await;
            count += 1;

            if let Err(send_error) = tx.send(count) {
                eprintln!("Could not send interval {count}: {send_error}");
                break;
            };
        }
    });

    ReceiverStream::new(rx)
}
```
