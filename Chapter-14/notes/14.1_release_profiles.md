## Customizing Builds with Release Profiles

***Release profiles*** are predefined and customizable profiles with different
configurations that allow a programmer to have more control over various
options for compiling code. Each profile is configured independently of the
others.

Cargo has two main profiles:
- the `dev` profile which is used when running `cargo build`. the `dev` profile
  is defined with good defaults for quick compilation, which is necessary for
  iterative development.
- the `release` profile used when running `cargo build --release`. the
  `release` profule has good defaults for release builds, which should be
  optimized (at the cost of compilation time).

Cargo has default settings for the `dev` and `release` profiles that're applied
when `[profile.*]` hasn't been added to the project's Cargo.toml file.
`[profile.*]` sections allow you to override the default build settings. The
default opt-level settings for the `dev` and `release` profiles are:
```TOML
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
```
- The `opt-level` setting controls the number of optimizations Rust will apply
  to your code, with a range of 0 to 3.
