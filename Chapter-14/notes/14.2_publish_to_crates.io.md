## Publishing a Crate to Crates.io

***Documentation comments*** are made using `///`, they generate HTML
documentation. The HTML displays the contents of documentation comments for
public API items intended for programmers interested in knowing how to use the
crate. For example:
```rust
/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let arg = 5;
/// let answer = my_crate::add_one(arg);
///
/// assert_eq!(6, answer);
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

We can generate the HTML docs from this doc comment by running `cargo doc`,
which runs the `rustdoc` tool distributed with Rust and puts the generated HTML
documentation in the target/doc directory.
- For convenience, running `cargo doc --open` will build the HTML for your
  current crate’s documentation (as well as the documentation for all of your
  crate’s dependencies) and open the result in a web browser. It'd look
  something like: ![](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/img/trpl14-01.png)

### Commonly Used Sections

Here are some sections that crate authors often use in their docs:
- `# Examples`: examples of how to use the thing.
- `# Panics`: scenarios in which the function being documented could panic.
- `# Errors`: If the function returns a `Result`, this header would explain the
  kinds of errors that could occur and why.
- `# Safety`: If the function is `unsafe` to call, this header should explain
  why it's unsafe and should cover the invariants the function expects callers
  to uphold.
  
### Documentation Comments as Tests

Running `cargo test` will run the code examples in your documentation as tests
(WAT!?)
- Running `cargo test` with the docs for `add_one` will show test results like
  this:
```
Doc-tests my_crate

running 1 test
test src/lib.rs - add_one (line 5) ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.27s
```

### Commenting Contained Items

There's also `//!` style doc comments. These are typically used inside the
crate root or inside a module to summarize it as a whole. For example:
```rust
//! # My Crate
//!
//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain
//! calculations more convenient.

/// Adds one to the number given.
// --snip--
```
and it'll display something like this after running `cargo doc --open`:

### Exporting a Convenient Public API with `pub use`

If the structure of your library isn't convenient for others to use from a
different library, you can re-export items to make a public structure that's
different from the private structure using `pub use`. Re-exporting takes a
public item in one location and makes it public in another location.

For example:
```rust
//! # Art
//!
//! A library for modeling artistic concepts.

pub mod kinds {
    /// The primary colors according to the RYB color model.
    pub enum PrimaryColor {
        Red,
        Yellow,
        Blue,
    }

    /// The secondary colors according to the RYB color model.
    pub enum SecondaryColor {
        Orange,
        Green,
        Purple,
    }
}

pub mod utils {
    use crate::kinds::*;

    /// Combines two primary colors in equal amounts to create
    /// a secondary color.
    pub fn mix(c1: PrimaryColor, c2: PrimaryColor) -> SecondaryColor {
        // --snip--
    }
}
```
The docs page for this crate would look like:
![](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/img/trpl14-03.png)
This can easily get difficult to navigate for those unfamiliar with the
internal structure of your library. Accessing the types would look like
```rust
use art::kinds::PrimaryColor;
use art::utils::mix;
```
which is kind of long and annoying. Instead we can utilize `pub use` like so:
![](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/img/trpl14-04.png)
Now users of the crate can more easily access the types by doing the following:
```rust
use art::mix;
use art::PrimaryColor;
```

### Adding Metadata to a New Crate

no description, license, license-file, documentation, homepage or repository.

To publish a crate to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) you need to have at least
the following in your crate's Cargo.toml:
- name
- version
- edition
- description
- license

If you don't have these, you will be unable to run `cargo publish`. e.g.
Cargo.toml:
```toml
[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
description = "A fun game where you guess what number the computer has chosen."
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"

[dependencies]
```

### Publishing a New Version of an Existing Crate

You can just run `cargo publish` again to publish a new version of an existing crate.
- use [Semantic Versioning Rules](http://semver.org/) as a resource to help you
  figure out how to number your crate versions.
  
### Deprecating Versions from Crates.io with cargo yank
Yanking a version prevents new projects from depending on that version while
allowing all existing projects that depend on it to continue.
- Basically, a yank means that all projects with a Cargo.lock will not break,
  and any future Cargo.lock files generated will not use the yanked version.
