## Separating Modules into Different Files
Our `restaurant` library has this directory structure:
```
restaurant
 ├── Cargo.lock
 ├── Cargo.toml
 └── src/
     └── lib.rs
```
and the following code in *src/lib.rs*:
```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_wait() {}
        
        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }
    
    pub mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}
        
        fn serve_order() {}
        
        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}

mod back_of_house {
    pub mod chef {
        fn fix_incorrect_order() {
            cook_order();
            super::deliver_order();
        }

        fn cook_order() {}
    }
}

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

fn deliver_order() {}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```
This code works fine, but it's obvious that this can quickly get chaotic and unorganized as we add more modules and items, and we would be further from being able to easily understand how the module tree works.

Fortunately we can organize the `restaurant` directory in a way that follows the structure of it's module tree. Recall the Modules Cheat Sheet from section 7.2 tells us the places the compiler will look for any module's or submodule's code.

Make the `restaurant` directory look like this:
```
restaurant
 ├── Cargo.lock
 ├── Cargo.toml
 └── src/
     ├── lib.rs 
     ├── front_of_house.rs
     ├── back_of_house.rs
     ├── front_of_house/
     │   ├── hosting.rs
     │   └── serving.rs
     └── back_of_house/
         └── chef.rs
```
Now look at the modules' in *src/lib.rs*. Reorganize the code in the definitions of each module into their corresponding files nested in the project directory and then import the code from those files into it's parent module scope. For example, in the case of `front_of_house::serving::{take_order, serve_order, take_payment}`, we add the following code:
```rust
/* filename: src/front_of_house/serving.rs */
pub fn take_order() {}
pub fn serve_order() {}
pub fn take_payment() {}


/* filename: src/front_of_house.rs */
pub mod serving;


/* filename: src/lib.rs */
mod front_of_house;
```
Doing this with the rest of the code makes it so the `restaurant` directory matches the crate tree, which looks like:
```
crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment
```
