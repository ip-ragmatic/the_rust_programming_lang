Compound types are able to group multiple values into one compound type.

~Tuples~ are compound types with a fixed-length defined at inception, and are able to store different types of values
    - like variables, you can add "mut" to make it mutable. but only the values of the tuple are mutable
    - can access a tuple's value by destructuring it or by using . followed by index of the value in tuple:
        Destructuring:
            fn main() {
                let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
                let (x, y, z) = tup;
                println!("The value of y is: {y}");
            }
        Index:
            fn main() {
                let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
                let a = x.0;
                let b = x.1;
                let c = x.2;
            }
    - A Unit in Rust is an empty tuple. A unit's value and type are both written as (), which represents an empty value or 
      an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t return any other value.
      
~Arrays~ group a fixed number of values that must all have the same type.
    - useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap
    - type annotate array using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then number of elements in array
    - code
        > let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
          let first = a[0] // similar to python list access, yields the value 1
        > let a = [3; 5]; // a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

~Vectors~ are similar collection type to an array except they can grow or shrink in size.
    - If you’re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector.
