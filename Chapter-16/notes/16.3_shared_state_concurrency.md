## Shared-State Concurrency

Message passing is just one of the ways to handle concurrency. Another one is for multiple threads
to share the same memory. Remember the, "do not communicate by sharing memory" from the Go docs
quote. With that in mind, why would message-passing caution not to use memory sharing?

Perhaps complexity maybe? Recall from chapter 15 how smart pointers made multiple ownership
possible. But also recall how doing so added complexity because the different owners needed
managing. Fortunately Rust's type system and ownership rules greatly assist in correctly managing
this type of thing. e.g. mutexes, one of the more common concurrency primitives for shared memory.

### Using Mutexes to Allow Access to Data from One Thread at a Time

*Mutex* stands for *mutual exclusion*, as in, a mutex allows only one thread to access some data at any given time. To access the data in a mutex, a thread must first signal that it wants access by asking to acquire the mutex's lock, which is data structure that's part of the mutex. The lock keeps track of who currently has exclusive access to the data. Therefore, the mutex is described as guarding the data it holds via the locking system.

Mutexes have a reputation for being difficult to use because you have to remember two rules:
- You must attempt to acquire the lock before using the data.
- When done with the data that the mutex guards, you must unlock the data so other threads can acquire the lock.

Management of mutexes can be incredibly tricky to get right, which is why so many people are
enthusiastic about channels. However, thanks to Rust's type system and ownership rules, you can't
get locking and unlocking wrong.

#### The API of Mutex\<T\>

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let m = Mutex::new(5);
    
    {
        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
        *num = 6;        
    }
    println!("m = {m:?}"); // m = Mutex { data: 6, poisoned: false, .. }
}
```
- To access the data inside the mutex, we use the `lock` method to acquire the lock. This call
  blocks the current thread from doing work until it's our turn to have the lock.
  - the call to `lock` fails if another thread holding the lock panicked. In that case, no one would
    ever be able to get the lock, so `unwrap` and have this thread panic if in that situation.
- After acquiring the lock, the return value (`num`) can be treated as a mutable reference to the
  data inside. The type system ensures we acquire a lock before using the value in `m`. The type of
  `m` is `Mutex<i32>`, so `lock` is necessary to use the inner `i32` value (can't access it
  otherwise). 
- `Mutex<T>` is a smart pointer. The call to `lock` returns a smart pointer called `MutexGuard`,
  wrapped in a `LockResult` that's handled by calling `unwrap`. 
  - `MutexGuard` implements `Deref` to point at the inner data. `MutexGuard` also releases the lock
    automatically when it goes out of scope (it's `Drop` implementation). This ensures that even if
    we forget to release the lock, it happens once out of scope.

#### Sharing a Mutex\<T\> Between Multiple Threads

Try to share a value between multiple threads using `Mutex<T>`. Spin up 10 threads and have each increment a counter value by 1, so the counter goes from 0 to 10. The next example will have a compiler error, use that error to learn more about using `Mutex<T>` and how Rust helps us use it correctly.

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Mutex::new(0);
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();

            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```
```

#### Multiple Ownership with Multiple Threads

Let's try to use `Rc<T>` to try and allow multiple ownership.
- hint: won't work because `Rc<T>` only works for single threaded scenarios
```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Rc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Rc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();

            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```
```

- the important part to focus on: `` `Rc<Mutex<i32>>` cannot be sent between threads safely``. The
  compiler also says why: ``the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<Mutex<i32>>` ``.
  - `Send` is one of the traits that ensures the types we use with threads are meant for use in
    concurrent situations.
    
`Rc<T>` is not safe to share across threads. When `Rc<T>` manages the reference count, it adds to
the count for each call to `clone` and subtracts from the count when each clone is dropped.
- it doesnâ€™t use any concurrency primitives to ensure changes to the count can't be interrupted by
  other threads. This could lead to (wrong counts) subtle bugs that could cause memory leaks or a
  value being dropped before being done with it.
  
#### Atomic Reference Counting with Arc\<T\>

`Arc<T>` is a type like `Rc<T>` that's safe to use in concurrent situations. The *a* stands for
*atomic* (an *atomically reference counted* type).
- ***Atomics*** are an additional kind of primitive type that's safe to share across threads.
    > See the standard library documentation for
    > [std::sync::atomic](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/index.html) for more details.
    
Now changing all occurrences of `Rc` to `Arc`:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let c = Arc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = c.lock().unwrap();

            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```
```
Result: 10
```

Using this strategy, you can divide a calculation into independent parts, split those parts across
threads, and then use a `Mutex<T>` to have each thread update the final result with its part.
> if you are doing simple numerical operations, there are types simpler than `Mutex<T>` types
> provided by the [`std::sync::atomic`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/index.html) module
> of the standard library.

### Similarities Between RefCell\<T\>/Rc\<T\> and Mutex\<T\>/Arc\<T\>

As you can see in the above code, `Mutex<T>` provides interior mutability in the same way
`RefCell<T>` does; can mutate contents in an `Rc<T>` with `RefCell<T>`, can mutate contents in an
`Arc<T>` with `Mutex<T>`.

Similar to how using `Rc<T>` came with the risk of making reference cycles, `Mutex<T>` comes with
the risk of creating *deadlocks*.
- ***Deadlocks*** occur when an operation needs to lock two resources but two threads have each
  acquired one of the locks, causing them to wait for each other forever.

### Quiz

1. In some concurrency APIs, a mutex is separate from the data it guards. For example, imagine a
   hypothetical Mutex API like this:
```rust
let mut data = Vec::new();
let mx: Mutex = Mutex::new();
{
    let _guard = mx.lock();
    data.push(0);
}
```
Which of the following best describes why Rust uses `Mutex<T>` instead of just `Mutex`?
***Answer:*** To prevent accessing a mutex's data without locking the mutex
- The `Mutex<T>` design ensures that a mutex's data can only be accessed when the mutex is locked,
  and conversely that the mutex is unlocked once the data is no longer accessible.
  
2. Determine whether the program will pass the compiler. If it passes, write the expected output of
   the program if it were executed.
```rust
use std::{sync::Arc, thread};
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("Hello world");
    let a = Arc::new(&s);
    let a2 = Arc::clone(&a);
    let t = thread::spawn(move || a2.len());
    let len = t.join().unwrap();
    println!("{} {}", a, len);
}
```
***Answer:*** Doesn't compile
- An `Arc` is still not safe to use if its data contains a reference, since the reference could (in
  theory) be invalidated before all threads containing the `Arc` finish executing.
