## Ownership Inventory #2

### 1. If you tried to compile this function, what best describes the compiler error you would get?
```rust
/* PROGRAM 1 */
/// Removes all the zeros in-place from a vector of integers.
fn remove_zeros(v: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    for (i, t) in v.iter().enumerate().rev() {
        if *t == 0 {
            v.remove(i);
            v.shrink_to_fit();
        }
    }
}
```
#### Answer:
`v.remove(i)` cannot borrow `v` as mutable.`v.iter()` immutably borrows `v` for as long as the for-loop runs. But `v.remove(i)` requires `v` to be mutably borrowed, and recall something can't be mutably and immutably borrowed at the same time. So the compiler rejects the function in program 1 since `v.remove(1)` conflicts with the iterator.

### 2. Assume that the compiler did NOT reject the function in program 1. Which (if any) of the following programs would (1) pass the compiler, and (2) possibly cause undefined behavior if executed? Check each program that satisfies both criteria, OR check "None of these programs" if none are satisfying. Normally if you try to compile `remove_zeroes`, the compiler returns the following error: 
```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `*v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> test.rs:5:13
  |
3 |     for (i, t) in v.iter().enumerate().rev() {
  |                   --------------------------
  |                   |
  |                   immutable borrow occurs here
  |                   immutable borrow later used here
4 |         if *t == 0 {
5 |             v.remove(i);
  |             ^^^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
```
#### Answer:
```rust
CORRECT ✅

let mut v = vec![1, 2, 0, 3];
remove_zeros(&mut v);

let mut v = vec![5, 5, 0];
remove_zeros(&mut v);
println!("{:?}", v);
```
- if compiler doesn't reject `remove_zeroes`, then undefined behavior would occur when a 0 appears after the first element of `v`. The call to `v.shrink_to_fit()` resizes the vector, thus reallocating memory. This would then invalidate the iterator `v.iter()` since it is a pointer to `v`. But since `v` is reallocated to new memory, `v.iter()` would then be a dangling pointer. `println!("{:?}", v)` being called after `remove_zeroes` is irrelevant to the undefined behavior since the issue is internal to `remove_zeroes`.

### 3. Of the following fixes (highlighted in yellow), which `remove_zeroes` fix best satisfies these three criteria: (1) The fixed function passes the Rust compiler, (2) The fixed function preserves the intention of the original code, and (3) The fixed function does not introduce unnecessary inefficiencies
#### Answer:
```rust
CORRECT ✅
fn remove_zeros(v: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    for i in (0 .. v.len()).rev() {
        if v[i] == 0 {
            v.remove(i);
            v.shrink_to_fit();
        }
    }
}
```
- anything to do with allocating a new vector is innecessary and also deviates from the original intent of the program. The simplest strategy would then be to iterate over a range `0..v.len()`, which doesn't borrow `v`. And then index `v` at index `i` (or `v[i]`). Do this in reverse though to avoid removing missing indexes.

### 4. If you tried to compile this function, what best describes the compiler error you would get?
```rust
/* PROGRAM 2 */
/// Reverses the elements of a vector in-place
fn reverse(v: &mut Vec<String>) {
    let n = v.len();
    for i in 0 .. n / 2 {
        std::mem::swap(&mut v[i], &mut v[n - i - 1]);
    }
}
```
#### Answer:
cannot borrow `v` as mutable twice for `v[i]` and `v[n - i - 1]`. Accessing a specific value of a vector removes permissions from each element in that vector. So, `&mut v[i]` and `&mut v[n - i - 1]` are treated as a single item, and we therefore get an error where `v` cannot be mutably borrowed twice.

### 5. Assume that the compiler did NOT reject the function in program 2. Which (if any) of the following programs would (1) pass the compiler, and (2) possibly cause undefined behavior if executed? Check each program that satisfies both criteria, OR check "None of these programs" if none are satisfying. Normally if you try to compile `reverse`, the compiler returns the following error: 
```
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `*v` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> test.rs:5:40
  |
5 |         std::mem::swap(&mut v[i], &mut v[n - i - 1]);
  |         --------------      -          ^ second mutable borrow occurs here
  |         |                   |
  |         |                   first mutable borrow occurs here
  |         first borrow later used by call
```
#### Answer:
None of these programs. This function cannot cause a memory safety violation because `i != n - i - 1` for all `i`, so the two mutable references always refer to different elements. Note that the `let x = &v[0]` program would not compile, as Rust's borrow checker would not allow `reverse` to be called while `x` is live.

### 6. Of the following fixes (highlighted in yellow), which `reverse` fix best satisfies these three criteria: (1) The fixed function passes the Rust compiler, (2) The fixed function preserves the intention of the original code, and (3) The fixed function does not introduce unnecessary inefficiencies
#### Answer:
```rust
fn reverse(v: &mut Vec<String>) {
    let n = v.len();
    for i in 0 .. n / 2 {
        let p1 = &mut v[i] as *mut String;
        let p2 = &mut v[n - i - 1] as *mut String;
        unsafe { std::ptr::swap_nonoverlapping(p1, p2, 1); }
    }
}
```
- In a situation where the borrow checker rejects an operation that is actually safe and has no workaround, then unsafe code is sometimes acceptable if it's critical to avoid allocations. In this specific case, you should actually use [`Vec::swap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.swap), which is internally implemented with heavily-tested unsafe code similar to the code above. But in general, if the standard library doesn't happen to support your use case, then `unsafe` can be acceptable if used correctly.
