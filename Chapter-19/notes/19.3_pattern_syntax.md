# Pattern Syntax

> - Only noting the more unique pattern syntax.
> - Will neglect to include `fn main()` in the code blocks.

## Multiple Patterns

Multiple patterns can be matched using `|`; this is known as a pipe, or *or* operator. For example:

```rust
    let x = 1;

    match x {
        1 | 2 => println!("one or two"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        _ => println!("anything"),
    }
```

## Matching Ranges of Values with ..=

`..=` syntax allows matching to an inclusive range of values. The compiler checks that the range
isn't empty at compile time, and b/c `char` and numeric values are the only types Rust can tell if
empty or not, ranges are only allowed with them.

Numeric example:

```rust
    let x = 5;

    match x {
        1..=5 => println!("one through five"),  // this prints
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
```

`char` example:

```rust
    let x = 'c';

    match x {
        'a'..='j' => println!("early ASCII letter"),  // this prints
        'k'..='z' => println!("late ASCII letter"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
```

## Destructuring to Break Apart Values

### Destructuring Structs

Here are some examples of destructuring structs.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };

    let Point { x: a, y: b } = p;  // a = 0, b = 7
    assert_eq!(0, a);
    assert_eq!(7, b);
}
```
- Rust has a shorthand for patterns that match struct fields: you only need to list the name of the
  struct field, and the variables created from the pattern will have the same names. For example,
  this does the same thing but does so with less verbosity:

  ```rust
  struct Point {
      x: i32,
      y: i32,
  }
  
  fn main() {
      let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };
  
      let Point { x, y } = p;  // x = 0, y = 0 (see, less stuff)
      assert_eq!(0, x);
      assert_eq!(7, y);
  }
  ```

Can also desctructure structs in `match` expressions:

```rust
fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };

    match p {
        Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the x axis at {x}"),
        Point { x: 0, y } => println!("On the y axis at {y}"),  // this prints
        Point { x, y } => {
            println!("On neither axis: ({x}, {y})");
        }
    }
}
```

### Destructuring Enums

The pattern to destructure an enum corresponds to the way the data stored within the enum is
defined. For example:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(0, 160, 255);

    match msg {
        Message::Quit => {
            println!("The Quit variant has no data to destructure.");
        }
        Message::Move { x, y } => {
            println!("Move in the x direction {x} and in the y direction {y}");
        }
        Message::Write(text) => {
            println!("Text message: {text}");
        }
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => {  // this arm is matched and its data is unpacked
            println!("Change the color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}")
        }
    }
}
```

### Destructuring Nested Structs & Enums

Matching can work on nested items too. For example:

```rust
enum Color {
    Rgb(i32, i32, i32),
    Hsv(i32, i32, i32),
}

enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(Color),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(0, 160, 255));

    match msg {
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Rgb(r, g, b)) => {
            println!("Change color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}");
        }
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(h, s, v)) => {  // this arm is matched and its data is unpacked
            println!("Change color to hue {h}, saturation {s}, value {v}")
        }
        _ => (),
    }
}
```

We can specify complex conditions in one match expression, even if multiple enums are involved.

### Destructuring Structs and Tuples

We can mix, match, and nest destructuring patterns in even more complex ways. For example:

```rust
    let ((feet, inches), Point { x, y }) = ((3, 10), Point { x: 3, y: -10 });
```

- now the values in this tuple containing another tuple and a struct have been unpacked the
  variables. `feet` contains `3`, `inches` contains `10`, `x` contains `3`, and `y` contains `-10`.

## Ignoring Values in a Pattern

### Using `_` to Ignore Values

Pretty self explanatory. If there's ever any values we want to ignore when using destructuring
patterns, just use `_` to ignore the value corresponding to that position.

Can also ignore an unused variable by prefixing `_` to its name. For example:

```rust
    let _x = 5;  // won't get unused variable warning
    let y = 10;  // will get unused variable warning
```
- Do this so `clippy` doesn't yell at you.

### Ignoring Remaining Parts of a Value with ..

With values that have many parts, we can use the `..` syntax to use specific parts and ignore the
rest, avoiding the need to list underscores for each ignored value. The `..` pattern ignores any
parts of a value not explicitly matched in the rest of the pattern.

```rust
    struct Point {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,
        z: i32,
    }

    let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };

    match origin {
        Point { x, .. } => println!("x is {x}"),  // ignores fields y and z
    }
```

The syntax `..` will expand to as many values as it needs to be. For example:

```rust
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);

    match numbers {
        (first, .., last) => {
            println!("Some numbers: {first}, {last}");  // first = 2, last = 32
        }
    }
```

## Extra Conditionals with Match Guards

A *match guard* is an additional if condition, specified after the pattern in a match arm, that must also match for that arm to be chosen. Match guards are useful for expressing more complex ideas than a pattern alone allows. For example:

```rust
    let num = Some(4);

    match num {
        Some(x) if x % 2 == 0 => println!("The number {x} is even"),  // this prints
        Some(x) => println!("The number {x} is odd"),
        None => (),
    }
```

- There is no way to express the `if x % 2 == 0` condition within a pattern, so the match guard
  gives the ability to express this logic.
- Note that the additional expressiveness on arms with match guards don't "count" towards
  exhaustiveness.

We can also use the *or* operator `|` in conjunction with match guards. For example:

```rust
    let x = 4;
    let y = false;

    match x {
        4 | 5 | 6 if y => println!("yes"),
        _ => println!("no"),  // this prints
    }
```

- The match condition states that the arm only matches if the value of `x` is equal to `4`, `5`, or
  `6` and if `y` is `true`.

## @ Bindings

The *at* operator `@` lets us create a variable that holds a value at the same time as we're testing
that value for a pattern match. In other words, using `@` lets us test a value and save it in a
variable within one pattern.

Say we want to test that a `Message::Hello` `id` field is within the range `3..=7`. We also want to
bind the value to the variable `id_variable` so we can use it in the code associated with the arm.
We could name this variable `id`, the same as the field (but for this example we'll use a different
name):

```rust
    enum Message {
        Hello { id: i32 },
    }

    let msg = Message::Hello { id: 5 };

    match msg {
        Message::Hello {
            id: id_variable @ 3..=7,
        } => println!("Found an id in range: {id_variable}"),  // this prints
        Message::Hello { id: 10..=12 } => {
            println!("Found an id in another range")
        }
        Message::Hello { id } => println!("Found some other id: {id}"),
    }
```
```
Found an id in range: 5
```
