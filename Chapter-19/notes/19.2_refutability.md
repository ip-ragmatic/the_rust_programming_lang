# Refutability: Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match

Patterns come in two forms: refutable and irrefutable. Patterns that will match for any possible
value passed are **irrefutable**. Patterns that can fail to match for some possible value are
**refutable**. Some examples:

- In the expression `if let Some(x) = a_value`, `Some(x)` is refutable. If the value in the
  `a_value` variable is `None` rather than `Some`, the `Some(x)` pattern won't match.
- In the expression `if let &[x, ..] = a_slice`, `&[x, ..]` is refutable. If the value in the
  `a_slice` variable has zero elements, the `&[x, ..]` pattern won't match.
