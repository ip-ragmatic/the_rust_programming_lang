## 10.4 Ownership Inventory #3


1. If you tried to compile this program, which of the following best describes the compiler error you would get?
    ```rust
    /// Returns the n-th largest element in a slice
    fn find_nth<T: Ord + Clone>(elems: &[T], n: usize) -> T {
        elems.sort();
        let t = &elems[n];
        return t.clone();
    }
    ```
#### Answer:
cannot borrow elems as mutable for sort. The method `slice::sort` expects a mutable reference to a slice, but instead gets an immutable reference.

<br/>

2. Normally if you try to compile `find_nth`, the compiler returns the following error:
    ```
    error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*elems` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
     --> test.rs:3:5
      |
    3 |     elems.sort();
      |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ `elems` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
    ```
    Assume that the compiler did NOT reject this function. Which (if any) of the following programs would (1) pass the compiler, and (2) possibly cause undefined behavior if executed? Check each program that satisfies both criteria, OR check "None of these programs" if none are satisfying.
#### Answer:
None of these programs. This program is technically memory-safe because `slice::sort` is only capable of moving elements around, not freeing them. For instance, `&v[0]` is guaranteed to point to some number after calling `find_nth`, even if it is not the original number.

Note that `find_nth(&v, 10)` does not cause undefined behavior because Rust performs checks on array accesses, so evaluating `&v[10]` will panic.

3. Of the following fixes (highlighted in yellow), which `find_nth` fix best satisfies these three criteria: (1) The fixed function passes the Rust compiler, (2) The fixed function preserves the intention of the original code, and (3) The fixed function does not introduce unnecessary inefficiencies
#### Answer:
```rust
CORRECT ✅
fn find_nth<T: Ord + Clone>(elems: &[T], n: usize) -> T {
    let mut elem_refs: Vec<&T> = elems.iter().collect();
    elem_refs.sort();
    let t = elem_refs[n];
    return t.clone();
}
```
A function like `find_nth` is clearly intended to be a read-only function, i.e. to extract some property of the input sequence. Any solution which mutates or drops the input therefore does not preserve the original function's intention, even if it is more efficient than creating an auxiliary vector.

Creating a `Vec<&T>` is preferable to creating a `Vec<T>`, since if `T` is large, then `elems.to_vec()` could be expensive. However, if we knew that `T: Copy`, then `to_vec` would be preferable to reduce the number of pointer dereferences within `elems.sort()`.

4. If you tried to compile this program, which of the following best describes the compiler error you would get?
    ```rust
    struct TestResult {
        /// Student's scores on a test
        scores: Vec<usize>,

        /// A possible value to curve all scores
        curve: Option<usize>
    }
    impl TestResult {  
        pub fn get_curve(&self) -> &Option<usize> { 
            &self.curve 
        }

        /// If there is a curve, then increments all 
        /// scores by the curve
        pub fn apply_curve(&mut self) {
            if let Some(curve) = self.get_curve() {
                for score in self.scores.iter_mut() {
                    *score += *curve;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
#### Answer:
in `apply_curve`, cannot borrow `self.scores` as mutable for `iter_mut`. Due to lifetime elision, the function `get_curve` has the type signature `get_curve<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a Option<usize>`, This means that a call to `self.get_curve()` extends the entire borrow on `self`, not just on `self.curve`. Therefore `self` is immutably borrowed inside the scope of `let Some(curve) = ...`, and `self.scores.iter_mut()` cannot be called.

<br/>

5. Normally if you try to compile the `TestResult` code, the compiler returns the following error:
    ```
    error[E0502]: cannot borrow `self.scores` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
      --> test.rs:17:26
       |
    16 |         if let Some(curve) = self.get_curve() {
       |                              ---------------- immutable borrow occurs here
    17 |             for score in self.scores.iter_mut() {
       |                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
    18 |                 *score += *curve;
       |                           ------ immutable borrow later used here
    ```
    Assume that the compiler did NOT reject this code. Which (if any) of the following programs would (1) pass the compiler, and (2) possibly cause undefined behavior if executed? Check each program that satisfies both criteria, OR check "None of these programs" if none are satisfying.
#### Answer:
None of these programs. This program is actually safe as written. It is a limitation of the borrow checker to not understand that `get_curve` only borrows `curve`, and doesn't affect `scores`. However, in theory if `get_curve` were changed to return a reference to something with `self.scores`, then memory safety could potentially be violated.

6. Of the following fixes (highlighted in yellow), which `TestResult` fix best satisfies these three criteria: (1) The fixed function passes the Rust compiler, (2) The fixed function preserves the intention of the original code, and (3) The fixed function does not introduce unnecessary inefficiencies
#### Answer:
```rust
CORRECT ✅
pub fn apply_curve(&mut self) {
    if let Some(curve) = self.curve {
        for score in self.scores.iter_mut() {
            *score += curve;
        }
    }
}
```
By inlining the definition of get_curve into `apply_curve`, the borrow checker understands that `self.curve` is not `self.scores`, so it allows the function to compile. This is a common workaround for this type of borrow checker limitation.

Another option is to leverage the fact that `self.curve` is cheap to copy and use `Option::copied`, which would release the borrow on self as soon as `.copied()` is called.
