## Generic Data Types
Generics are used to create definitions for items like function signatures or structs, which can the be used with different concrete data types.

### In Function Definitions
When defining a function that uses generics, we place the generics in the signature of the function where we would usually specify the data types of the parameters and return value. Doing so makes our code more flexible and provides more functionality to callers of our function while preventing code duplication.

Consider two functions that find the largest value in a slice, in this case of characters and numbers (`i32`). We'll then combine these into a single function that uses generics:
```rust
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
	let mut largest = &list[0];

	for item in list {
		if item > largest {
			largest = item;
		}
	}

	largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
	let mut largest = &list[0];

	for item in list {
		if item > largest {
			largest = item;
		}
	}

	largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];  // returns 100

    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];     // returns y

    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```
- functions `largest_i32` and `largest_char` have the same exact code in their function bodies

To eliminate the duplicate code, we introduce a generic type parameter `T`. To define the generic `largest` function for our case above, place type name (`T`) declarations inside angle brackets, `<>`, between the name of the function and the parameter list. The following won't compile, but it's a start:
```rust
/* WON'T COMPILE */
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
	let mut largest = &list[0];

	for item in list {
		if item > largest {
			largest = item;
		}
	}

	largest
}
```
- it won't compile because the compiler doesn't know anything about `T` at this time; does it implement `Copy`, is `i32` or `String`?

### In Struct Definitions
Can also define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more fields using the <> syntax. For example:
```rust
/* DOES COMPILE */
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
```
- compiles because we’ve used only one generic type to define `Point<T>`. definition says that the `Point<T>` struct is generic over some type `T`, and the fields `x` and `y` are both that same type, whatever it may be. If we create an instance of a `Point<T>` that has values of different types, the code wouldn't compile. For example, the following implementing the same `Point<T>`:
	```rust
	let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 }; // errors because T can't cover two different types
	```
	to get the above to work, we'd need to add `U` as a generic type parameter, this will cover the variability seen in this snippet. Like so:
	```rust
	struct Point<T, U> {
		x: T,
		y: U
	}

### In Enum Defintions
Basically do the same thing with enums as done with structs. For example, `Option<T>` from the standard library:
```rust
enum Option<T> {
	Some(T),
	None,
}
```
- only contains one generic type parameter because `Option` will only ever return some kind of value, or nothing

Let's look at the `Result` enum now, which contains `T` and `E` (seeing the pattern now?):
```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
	Ok(T),
	Err(E),
}
```

### In Method Definitions
We can use generic types in the definitions of enum and struct methods. For example, on the previous `Point<T>` struct we implement a method `x`:
```rust
struct Point<T> {
	x: T,
	y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
	fn x(&self) -> &T {
		&self.x
	}
}

fn main() {
	let p = Point { x: 6, y: 9 };
	println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```
- Note that we have to declare `T` just after `impl` so we can use `T` to specify that we’re implementing methods on the type `Point<T>`. By declaring `T` as a generic type after `impl`, Rust can identify that the type in the angle brackets in `Point` is a generic type rather than a concrete type.

Something else to keep in mind is that we can implement methods for a struct or enum containing a specific type, like `Point<f32>` instead of generic type `Point<T>`. In the case of the constraint, ignore the `<>` after `impl`. For example:
```rust
impl Point<f32> {
	fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
	// from origin, distance is sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
		(self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
	}
}
```
- note that we cannot implement specific and generic methods simultaneously

### Performance of Code Using Generics
Using generic types won't make your program run any slower than it would with concrete types by performing monomorphization of the code using generics at compile time.

***Monomorphization*** is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled.
- the compiler does the opposite of the steps used to create a generic function: the compiler looks at all places where generic code is called and generates code for the concrete types the generic code is called with

Let’s look at how this works by using the standard library’s generic `Option<T>` enum:
```rust
	let integer = Some(5);
	let float = Some(5.0);
```
the compiler reads the values used in `Option<T>` instances and identifies their types: `i32` and `f64`. It then expands the generic definition of` Option<T>` into two definitions specialized to `i32` and `f64`, and replaces the generic definition with the specific ones. The monomorphized version of the code looks similar to the following (the compiler uses different names than what's used here):
```rust
enum Option_i32 {
    Some(i32),
    None,
}

enum Option_f64 {
    Some(f64),
    None,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);
    let float = Option_f64::Some(5.0);
}
```
- generic `Option<T>` is replaced with the specific definitions created by the compiler
- because Rust compiles generic code into code specifying the type in each instance, we pay no runtime cost for using generics

### Quiz
1. Imagine using a third-party function whose implementation you don't know, but whose type signature is this:
```rust
fn mystery<T>(x: T) -> T {
  // ????
}
```
Then you call `mystery` like this:
```rust
let y = mystery(3);
```
Assuming `mystery` uses no `unsafe` code, then the value of `y` must be:
#### Answer:
The value of `y` is 3. The only possible function without `unsafe` code is the identity function; the return value is the input itself

2. Determine whether the program will pass the compiler. If it passes, write the expected output of the program if it were executed.
```rust
fn print_slice<T>(v: &[T]) {
  for x in v {
    println!("{x}"); // requires that x can be turned into a string
  }
}

fn main() {
  print_slice(&[1, 2, 3]);
}
```
#### Answer:
This program does not compile. If a type is generic (like `T`), we cannot assume anything about it, including the ability to turn it into a string. Therefore `println!("{x}")` is invalid because `x: &T`.

3. Determine whether the program will pass the compiler. If it passes, write the expected output of the program if it were executed.
```rust
struct Point<T> { x: T, y: T }

impl Point<i32> {
  fn f(&self) -> &i32 { &self.y }
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
  fn f(&self) -> &T { &self.x }
}

fn main() {
  let p: Point<i32> = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
  println!("{}", p.f());
}
```
#### Answer:
This program does not compile. These definitions of `f` conflict, and there is no way for Rust to determine which `f` should be used when `p.f()` is called. Therefore this is a compiler error.
