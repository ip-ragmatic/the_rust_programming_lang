## Rc\<T\>, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer

There are cases when a single value might have multiple owners. Graph data
structures for example. Multiple edges may point to the same node, and that
node is conceptually owned by all of the edges pointing to it. And that node
shouldn’t be cleaned up unless it doesn't have any edges pointing to it
(meaning it has no owners).

To enable this kind of "multiple ownership", use the type `Rc<T>` (stands for
***reference counting***). `Rc<T>` keeps track of the number of references to
it to determine if the value (in it) is still in use. If zero references to it,
the value can be cleaned up without invalidating any references.

We use `Rc<T>` to allocate some data on the heap for multiple parts of our
program to read, but we can't determine at compile time which part will finish
using the data last.
- IMPORTANT: `Rc<T>` can only be used in single-threaded scenarios.

### Using Rc\<T\> to Share Data

This time, we’ll create two lists that both share ownership of a third list.
Conceptually, this looks similar to

Lets redo the cons list example using `Rc<T>` instead of `Box<T>`, this way we
can create two lists that share ownership of a third. We'll create something
that looks similar to this:

![](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/img/trpl15-03.svg)

Create a list `a` that contains 5 and 10. Then create two more lists `b` which
starts with 3, and `c` which starts with 4. Then, both `b` and `c` will
continue on by pointing to `a`. Meaning that they'll both share `a`.

If we were to try this with `Box<T>`, it wouldn't work as `a` gets moved into
`b`. But then if we were to try the same thing with `c`, we'd get an error
stating `use of moved value: 'a'`. So instead we'll do the following:
```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
}
```
- we changed all instances of `Box<List>` and calls `Box::new(a)` to `Rc<List>`
  and `Rc::clone(&a)`.

Note that `Rc::clone` doesn't deep copy the data like regular `clone` does.
Instead, `Rc::clone` only increments the reference count. This is significantly
quicker than actually cloning. This means that when addressing performance
concerns in the code, we can disregard `Rc::clone` and only consider deep-copy
clones.

### Cloning an Rc\<T\> Increases the Reference Count

Let’s change `main` in the working example to see the reference counts changing
as we create and drop references to the `Rc<List>` in `a`. We place `c` into an
inner scope to see what happens when `c` goes out of scope.
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    println!("count after creating a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // ref count = 1
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    println!("count after creating b = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // ref count = 2
    {
        let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
        println!("count after creating c = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // ref count = 3
    }
    println!("count after c goes out of scope = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // ref count = 2
}
```
- each call to `Rc::clone(&a)` increases the reference count to `a` by 1.
- notice how we don't need to call a function to decrease the reference count;
  it gets taken care of automatically.
- `Rc::strong_count` gives the reference count to the particular value.
- The function is called `strong_count` because `Rc` also has a `weak_count`.
- once `b` and then `a` go out of scope, the reference count is 0 and
  `Rc<List>` is cleaned up.

`Rc<T>` allows us to share data between multiple parts of a program
***for reading only***. If it allowed multiple mutable references, it would
likely result in violating one of the borrowing rules from Chapter 4.
- multiple mutable borrows to the same place can lead to data races and
  inconsistencies.
  
### Quiz
1. Determine whether the program will pass the compiler. If it passes, write
   the expected output of the program if it were executed.
```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
fn main() {
    let n = Rc::new(1);
    let mut n2 = Rc::clone(&n);
    *n2 += 1;
    println!("{}", n);
}
```
**Answer**: doesn't compile
- Data inside `Rc` can't be mutated without the use of interior mutability.
  `Rc` enforces this property by implementing the `Deref` trait, but not the
  `DerefMut` trait.
  
2. Determine whether the program will pass the compiler. If it passes, write
   the expected output of the program if it were executed.
```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
struct Example;
impl Drop for Example {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("drop");
    }
}
fn main() {
    let x = Rc::new(Example);    
    let y = Rc::clone(&x);    
    println!("A");
    drop(x);
    println!("B");
    drop(y);    
    println!("C");
}
```
**Answer**: Output
```
A
B
drop
C
```
- `drop(x)` doesn't fully drop the value inside the reference-counted pointer
  because `y` is still alive. This means that `drop(x)` decreases the reference
  count to the value from 2 to 1, so it doesn't print anything as it's not
  dropped yet. Then `drop(y)` takes it from 1 to 0, and then the program
  actually cleans up the value, calling `Drop` trait's `drop` method, and thus
  printing "drop".
