## Reference Cycles Can Leak Memory

Rust's memory safety guarantees make it difficult, but not impossible, to
accidentally create memory that is never cleaned up (aka a *memory leak*).
- memory leaks are memory safe in Rust, meaning it's not one of the compiler's
  guarantees.
- `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>` allows memory leaks: we can create references where
  items refer to each other in a cycle. This leaks because the reference count
  of each item in the cycle never reaches 0 (and thus won't be dropped).

### Creating a Reference Cycle

We'll modify the `List` enum to not allow the ability to alter the value in it,
but instead allow the ability to modify the `List` value a `Cons` variant
points to. We'll also add a `tail` method that'll access the second item if we
have a `Cons` variant.

```rust
use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::cell:RefCell;
use std::rc:Rc;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(i32, RefCell<Rc<List>>),
    Nil,
}

impl List {
    fn tail(&self) -> Option<&RefCell<Rc<List>>> {
        match self {
            Cons(_, item) => Some(item),
            Nil => None,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, RefCell::new(Rc::new(Nil))));

    println!("a initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // a: 1
    println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());  // Nil

    let b = Rc::new(Cons(10, RefCell::new(Rc::clone(&a))));  // b -> a

    println!("a rc count after b creation = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // a: 2
    println!("b initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));  // b: 1
    println!("b next item = {:?}", b.tail());  // Some(RefCell { value: Cons(5, RefCell { value: Nil }) })

    if let Some(link) = a.tail() {
        *link.borrow_mut() = Rc::clone(&b);  // a -> b. cycle begins
    }

    println!("b rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));  // b: 2
    println!("a rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // a: 2

    // Uncomment the next line to see that we have a cycle; it will overflow
    // the stack. STACK OVERFLOW ERROR
    // println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());
}
```

If a more complex program allocated lots of memory in a cycle and held onto it
for a long time, the program would use more memory than it needed and might
overwhelm the system, causing it to run out of available memory.

### Preventing Reference Cycles: Turning an Rc\<T\> into a Weak\<T\>

We can create a *weak reference* to the value within an `Rc<T>` instance by
calling `Rc::downgrade` and passing a reference to the `Rc<T>`.
- ***Strong references*** are how you can share ownership of an `Rc<T>`
  instance.
- ***Weak references*** don’t express an ownership relationship, and their
  count doesn’t affect when an `Rc<T>` instance is cleaned up. Meaning they
  won't cause a reference cycle since they don't affect the strong count.
  
Call `Rc::downgrade` gets you a smart pointer of type `Weak<T>`. Calling this
method only increases the `weak_count` by 1; `Rc<T>` uses this count to track
how many `Weak<T>` references exists.
- `weak_count` doesn't contribute to ownership like `strong_count` does; it
  won't stop the value allocated from being dropped.
  - if item 1 contains a weak reference to item 2, item 2's `weak_count`
    increments by 1. 

To do anything with the value that `Weak<T>` points to, we need to make sure
the value exists (the value it references could've been dropped). We do this by
calling `upgrade` on a `Weak<T>` instance, which returns an `Option<Rc<T>>`;
this ensures that there won't be an invalid pointer. `upgrade` returns: `Some`
if `Rc<T>` `hasn't` been dropped, and `None` if `Rc<T>` *has* been dropped.
- calling `upgrade` on a `Weak<T>` doesn't remove the weak reference!!! The
  `weak_count` stays the same, but now `strong_count` increases by 1. In other
  words, it attempts to create an `Rc<T>` from the `Weak<T>` without modifying
  the `Weak<T>` itself.

### Creating a Tree Data Structure

To build a tree data structure, we need nodes that know about their parent and
child nodes, create a struct `Node` that holds its own `i32` value and
references to its childrens' `Node` values. Here are the basic requirements:
- each `Node` should be stored in a variable for direct access.
- `Node` should have fields `value`, `parent`, and `children`.
- each `Node` should own its `children`.
- if a `Node` has a parent, it should be aware of it and without causing a
  reference cycle.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    parent: RefCell<Weak<Node>>,
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,
}

fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: vec![].into(),
    });
    println!("leaf parent = {:#?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade().unwrap());
    
    let branch = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 5,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: vec![].into(),
    });
    *leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);
    parent.children.borrow_mut().push(Rc::clone(&leaf));
    println!("leaf parent = {:#?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());
    println!("parent children: = {:#?}", parent.children);
}
```
- lack of infinite output indicates that this code didn’t create a reference
  cycle.
- can also tell this by looking at the values we get from calling
  `Rc::strong_count` and `Rc::weak_count`!

#### Visualizing Changes to strong_count and weak_count

We can see what happens when `branch` is created and then dropped when it goes
out of scope by checking each `Rc<Node>`'s `strong_count` and `weak_count`
values.

Changes to main:
```rust
fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });

    println!(
        "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
        Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
    ); // leaf strong = 1, weak = 0

    {
        let branch = Rc::new(Node {
            value: 5,
            parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
            children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&leaf)]),
        });

        *leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);

        println!(
            "branch strong = {}, weak = {}",
            Rc::strong_count(&branch),
            Rc::weak_count(&branch),
        ); // branch strong = 1, weak = 1

        println!(
            "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
            Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
            Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
        );  // leaf strong = 2, weak = 0
    } // branch is dropped since it goes out of scope

    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade()); // leaf parent = None
    println!(
        "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
        Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
    );  // leaf strong = 1, weak = 0
}
```
- `leaf` never has a weak reference; no weak reference is created to point to
  it (strong references are, though). `leaf` does get a second strong reference
  for a bit because `Rc::clone(&leaf)` is called when initializing `branch`.
- `branch` contains a strong reference (creation) and 1 weak reference from
  `leaf`'s `parent` field being assigned `Rc::downgrade(&branch)`.
- once the inner scope code finishes, `branch` is deallocated and its strong
  and weak references to `leaf` are dropped as well. This makes `leaf`'s strong
  reference count go back to 1.
- the `println` after the inner scope ends prints `leaf parent = None` because
  `branch` doesn't exist anymore. This means that `leaf.parent` contains no
  inner value, so when `upgrade` is called on it it returns `None`.
  
### Summary

- `Box<T>` type has a known size and points to data allocated on the heap.
- `Rc<T>` type keeps track of the number of references to data on the heap so
  that the data can have multiple owners.
- `RefCell<T>` gives an immutable type that allows changes its inner value via
  its interior mutability. It also enforces the borrowing rules at runtime
  instead of compile time.
- `Deref` and `Drop` traits enable a lot of the functionality of smart
  pointers.
- Explored reference cycles that can cause memory leaks and how to prevent them
  using `Weak<T>` (`rc::Weak`).

### Quiz
1. Determine whether the program will pass the compiler. If it passes, write
   the expected output of the program if it were executed.
```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
fn main() {
    let r1 = Rc::new(0);
    let r4 = {
        let r2 = Rc::clone(&r1);
        Rc::downgrade(&r2)
    };
    let r5 = Rc::clone(&r1);
    let r6 = r4.upgrade();
    println!("{} {}", Rc::strong_count(&r1), Rc::weak_count(&r1));
}
```
***Answer:*** `3 1`
- the strong count by the end is 3, and the weak count is 1. recall upgrading a
  `Weak` doesn't modify the `Weak` itself, it just creates a new `Rc` from it.
- the value of `r4` is weak reference to `r1`, thus the weak count is
  incremented.
  - Even though `r2` goes out of scope, the `Weak` reference (`r4`) remains
    valid as long as there is at least one remaining strong reference (`r1`, in
    this case).
