## Using Box\<T\> to Point to Data on the Heap

Boxes (type `Box<T>`) allow you to store data on the heap rather than the
stack. What remains on the stack is the pointer to the heap data. They don't
have performance overhead other than what comes with storing data on the heap.
Although, they don't have many extra capabilities. Common cases to use it:
- When you have a type whose size can’t be known at compile time and you want
  to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size.
- When you have a large amount of data and want to transfer ownership but also
  ensure the data won’t be copied when you do.
  - transferring ownership of a large amount of data can take a long time
    because the data is copied around on the stack. To improve performance, we
    can store the data on the heap but within a box. Then, only the small
    amount of pointer data is copied around on the stack, while the data it
    references stays in one place on the heap.
- When you want to own a value and you care only that it’s a type that
  implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type.
  - this is known as a ***trait object*** (refer to chapter 17).
  
### Using Box\<T\> to Store Data on the Heap

How to use a box to store an `i32` value on the heap:
```rust
fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("b = {b}");
}
```
- variable `b` has the value `Box` which points to value `5`, which is
  allocated on the heap.
- when a `b` goes out of scope, it will be deallocated. The deallocation
  happens both for the box (stored on the stack) and the data it points to
  (stored on the heap).
  
### Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes

A value of *recursive type* can have another value of the same type as part of
itself. Recursive types pose an issue because Rust needs to know how much space
a type takes up at compile time. The nesting of values of recursive types could
theoretically continue infinitely, meaning Rust can’t know how much space the
value needs. But because boxes have a known size, recursive types can be
enabled by inserting a box in it's definition. A *cons list* is an example of a
recursive type.

#### The Cons List

The cons list is the Lisp version of a linked list. Its name comes from the
*construct function* in Lisp that constructs a new pair from its two arguments.
By calling `cons` on a pair containing a value and another pair, we can make
the cons lists made up of recursive pairs. 
- A cons list containing the list 1, 2, 3 with each pair in parentheses looks
  like:

A cons list is a data structure made up of nested pairs. Each item in a cons list contains two elements: the value of the current item and the next item. A cons list is produced by recursively calling the `cons` function. It could look something like:
```
(1, (2, (3, Nil)))
```
- the canonical name to denote the base case of the recursion is Nil. 

Now to try and implement it.
```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, List),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)));
}
```
This code won't compile, here's the error
```

  ```
The error shows this type "has infinite size". Meaning we've defined `List` with a variant that is recursive: it holds another value of itself directly. But Rust can't figure out how much space it needs to store a `List` value.

#### Computing the Size of a Non-Recursive Type

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```
To determine how much space to allocate for a `Message` value, Rust goes
through each of the variants to see which variant needs the most space. Rust
will see that: `Message::Quit` doesn’t need any space, `Message::Move` needs
enough space to store two `i32` values, and so forth. Because only one variant
will be used, the most space a `Message` value will need is the space it would
take to store the largest of its variants.

Now think about what's going on with the `List` enum. The compiler starts by
looking at the `Cons` variant. It holds a value of type `i32` and a value of
type `List`. To figure out how much memory `List` needs, the compiler looks at
the variants again starting with `Cons` again. The process repeats and
continues infinitely (thus the error we got). Here's a diagram depicting this:

#### Using Box\<T\> to Get a Recursive Type with a Known Size

Recall this part of the error above:
```
help: insert some indirection (e.g., a `Box`, `Rc`, or `&`) to break the cycle
```
"indirection" here refers to storing a pointer to the value instead of storing the value directly

`Box<T>` is a pointer and Rust always knows how much space a pointer requires
(a pointer’s size doesn’t change based on the amount of data it’s pointing to).
Meaning we can put a `Box<T>` inside the `Cons` variant instead of another
`List` value directly, where `Box<T>` will then point to the next `List` value
on the heap.
- Conceptually, we still have a list, created with lists holding other lists,
  but this implementation is now more like placing the items next to one
  another rather than inside one another.
```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Box::new(Cons(2, Box::new(Cons(3, Box::new(Nil))))));
}
```
Now the code will work.
